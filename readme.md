# Ski IO
Ski IO is my project 2 for IGME 430. In it the goal is to construct a webpage that is, using NodeJS and MongoDB, marketable.

## Game Idea
When first given the instructions I immediately knew I wanted to make a multiplayer game, and looked into using SocketIO. On doing this I figured I would make a multiplayer tile based farming game. However, due to my own inexperience using the tool I decided it might be a bit much to optimise. So I have changed into making a skiing game. All I need to do for that is save the map properties and player positions on the server. Its marketable in that I can use cosmetics and a cosmetic store.

## Webpack
For getting ES6, React, and such all working for the Client Code I used WebPack. Which needs a loader to compile React, so I just looked up some guides for it... This was the easiest and best I found.
